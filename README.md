# 🌟 Luminance – Personal Interactive Website

A one-page interactive website that introduces who I am — built from scratch as part of the **CRETIVOX INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE II (Batch 3)** challenge. This project reflects clean code, personality, and immersive scroll-triggered animations using **GSAP**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a personal site that's more than just working — it’s **interactive**, **fun**, and **alive**.
